# DroneRecycler

The Equipment Drone uses the Recycler on command.

Ping a recyclable pickup and your Equipment Drone will make it its life purpose to recycle it. Alternatively manually issue the command by pressing "C" after pinging (useful for multiplayer). Pressing the same key cancels the drone's behaviour if it has already been given the command.

### Notes
- Only the player's first Equipment Drone in the minion list can be interacted with in this way.
- Pinging/assigning a new pickup while the drone is on its way to recycle the previous one will cause it to change targets.

Both of these behaviours are intended. Queuing pickups or handling multiple drones can be done but then revoking a certain command gets more messy.
