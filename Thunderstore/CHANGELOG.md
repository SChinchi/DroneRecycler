**1.1.0**

* Added Risk of Options compatibility.
  * The command key config has changed its type in order to be supported by RoO. This will create some orphaned entries so you can delete the old cfg to generate a clean one. And don't forget to change its value if you didn't use the default one.
* Fixed an NRE when pinging a pickup while a minion has already died.
* Fixed a potential duplication bug when modifying the drone's AISkillDrivers.

**1.0.1**

* Updated for Seekers of the Storm.
* Removed an unnecessary Rpc call.
* Minor optimisation for the minion matching loop.
* Changed the author name to Chinchi as it should have been from the beginning. This will create a new config, feel free to delete the GChinchi one.

**1.0.0**

* Release
